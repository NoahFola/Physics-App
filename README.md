Physics Learning App

This project started as a personal experiment — a way to learn Flutter deeply by building something structured, practical, and complete. Instead of following endless tutorials, I wanted to understand real app development: organizing code, managing state, injecting dependencies, and structuring logic cleanly. So I chose to build something that could actually help people — a Physics Learning App.

Physics has always been one of those subjects that’s both fascinating and frustrating. The concepts are powerful, but the way they’re usually presented makes them hard to digest. This app aims to fix that. It breaks complex ideas into smaller, intuitive modules that students can work through at their own pace. Each topic includes worked examples, clear explanations, and short quizzes to test understanding.

The project also represents a mindset: learning by doing. Every feature is an opportunity to apply clean architecture principles, manage state effectively, and practice dependency injection in a real-world setting. I’m not just building an app; I’m building a foundation for writing scalable Flutter applications the right way.

Beyond the technical side, this project has a quiet purpose — to make studying Physics less stressful for students preparing for exams. It’s a way to organize knowledge, simplify revision, and give learners something they can depend on when they need clarity.

It’s a learning journey on both sides: I grow as a developer while others grow in understanding.
