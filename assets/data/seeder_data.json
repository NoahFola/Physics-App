In physics, we study motion to understand how objects move and what causes them to move.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n• **Position:** Where an object is located\n• **Displacement:** Change in position (vector quantity)\n• **Distance:** Total path length (scalar quantity)\n• **Time:** Duration of motion\n\n**Types of Motion:**\n• **Uniform Motion:** Constant velocity (zero acceleration)\n• **Non-uniform Motion:** Velocity changes over time (non-zero acceleration)\n",
